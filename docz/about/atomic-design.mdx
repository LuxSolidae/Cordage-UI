# Atomic Design Methodology

## Brief introduction

This design system will follow the Atomic Design Methodology. This methodology consists of separating all components in atoms, molecules, organism, templates, and pages. This allows us to maintain the design system more easily and makes every component more reusable. You can read more about it here http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/

All component levels will be used, but we are considering to reuse atoms, molecules, and organisms only for the NUU' design system.

This are just some examples:

## Atoms
- Button
- Input
- Checkbox
- Radio Button
- Select/Dropdown
- Avatar
- Alert
- Badge
- Grid
- Breadcrumbs

## Molecules
- Search
- Card
- IconAndText
- User

## Organisms
- Modal
- FilterableTable
- Navbar
- Sidebar
- Side Nav
